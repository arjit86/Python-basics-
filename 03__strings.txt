Chapter 3 – Strings

The string is a data type in Python.

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

We can primarily write a string in three ways:

Single quoted strings : a = 'arjit'
Double quoted strings : b = "arjit"
Triple quoted strings : c = '''arjit'''

String Slicing:
A string in Python can be sliced for getting a part of the string.

consider the following string 
    54321(-)This is the negative index of the string 
a = arjit 
    01234 This is the positive index of  the string 

String functions 
> len() function : It returns the length of the string.
  a = "arjit" 
  print (len(a)) #returns the value as 5

> endswith(“jit”) : This function tells whether the variable string ends 
with the string “jit” or not. If string is “arjit”, it returns for “jit” 
since arjit ends with jit.

> count(“c”) : It counts the total number of occurrences of any character.
capitalize() : This function capitalizes the first character 
of a given string.

> find(word) : This function finds a word and returns 
the index of first occurrence of that word in the string.

> replace(oldword, newword) : This function replaces 
the old word with the new word in the entire string.


Escape Sequence Characters:
Sequence of characters after backslash ‘\’ [Escape Sequence Characters]

Escape Sequence Characters comprises of more than one character but
 represents one character when used within the string.

Examples: \n (new line), \t (tab), \’ (single quote), \\ (backslash), etc.
