Chapter 4 – Lists and Tuples

Python Lists are containers to store a set of values of any data type.

friends = [‘Apple’, ‘Akash’, ‘Rohan’, 7, False]

The list can contain different types of elements such as int, float, string, Boolean, etc. Above list is a collection of different types of elements.

List Indexing
A list can be index just like a string.

L1 = [7, 9, ‘harry’]

L1[0] – 7

L1[1] – 9

L1[70] – Error

L1[0:2] – [7,9]         (This is known as List Slicing)

List Methods
Consider the following list:

sort() – updates the list to [1,2,7,8,15,21]
reverse() – updates the list to [15,21,2,7,8,1]
append(8) – adds 8 at the end of the list
insert(3,8) – This will add 8 at 3 index
pop(2) – It will delete the element at index 2 and return its value
remove(21) – It will remove 21 from the last

Tuples in Python:
A tuple is an immutable (can’t change or modified) data type in Python

a = ()              #It is an example of empty tuple

a = (1,)           #Tuple with only one element needs a comma

a = (1, 7, 2)   #Tuple with more than one element

Tuple methods:

Consider the following tuple,
a = (1, 7, 2)

count(1) – It will return the number of times 1 occurs in a.
index(1) – It will return the index of the first occurrence of 1 in a.
