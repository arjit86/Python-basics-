Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

Syntax:
''' a = {“key”: “value”,
“harry”: “code”,
“marks” : “100”,
“list”: [1,2,9]}
a[“key”]	# Prints value
a[“list”] 	# Prints [1,2,9] '''

Properties of Python Dictionaries
It is unordered
It is mutable
It is indexed
It cannot contain duplicate keys


Dictionary Methods
Consider the following dictionary:

a = {“name”: “Arjit”,
	“from”: “Nepal”,
	“marks”: [92,98,96]}
items() : returns a list of (key,value) tuple.
keys() : returns a list containing dictionary’s keys.
update({“friend”: “Sam”}) : updates the dictionary with supplied key-value pairs.
get(“name”) : returns the value of the specified keys (and value is returned e.g., “Harry” is returned here)

Sets in Python
Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.

S= Set()          # No repetition allowed!

S.add(1)

S.add(2)

# or Set = {1,2}
If you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical operations on sets, you can simply look at sets in python as data types containing unique values.

Properties of Sets
Sets are unordered # Elements order doesn’t matter
Sets are unindexed # Cannot access elements by index
There is no way to change items in sets
Sets cannot contain duplicate values
Operations on Sets
Consider the following set:

S = {1,8,2,3}
Len(s) : Returns 4, the length of the set
remove(8) : Updates the set S and removes 8 from S
pop() : Removes an arbitrary element from the set and returns the element removed.
clear() : Empties the set S
union({8, 11}) : Returns a new set with all items from both sets. #{1,8,2,3,11}
